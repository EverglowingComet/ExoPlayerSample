# ExoPlayerSample

## Overview

This project aims to create the entire mp4 http source file play flow with the customized classes.
The apis are originated from the ExoPlayer library provided by Google.
I created the custom classes for all the http source mp4 file play.
And furthurmore I created the jni level functions that reads data from the Http data source stream.
So developer can add the C-language level encryption-decription functions to this flow.
